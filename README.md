I created this project for the 2024 Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/2024

I used this opportunity to learn Rust so that I can use it for future personal projects.

I adhered to a strict No-AI policy while completing these challenges. This means no asking LLMs about the challenges, Rust, or anything else while working on these challenges. I stuck strictly to traditional resources including [the Rust Docs](rust-lang.org), Stack Overflow, Reddit, etc. However, I did not look at any solutions to the challenges, and all work is strictly my own.
